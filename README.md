The goal of this project is to create an interface where a user can
enter the ticker of some given security, and obtain a historical
price graph, in addition to the graph of an optional technical indicator.
It will make calls to the Yahoo Finance API to obtain the nessecary
price and volume data, but will perform all analytical computations
internally. The project will begin as a command line interface,
but may evolve into a multi-platform GUI or web based application.
